# First quarter test
##  My name is Alex

This is the first academic quarter test.
I am pretty sure it isn't interesting for you so you can go by.

So what's the deal

There is an array which consist of text elements
>string [] array = {"text","text"...}

My task is to make up a programm which check all the elements from this array and find which of them is equal or shorter than 3 symbols. 

Aftewards programm has to create new array which consist of elements was found in a previous step. 

To do list:
* Create remote repository
* Add README file
* Create flowchart
* Write code

Obviously during this journey I have to use GIT.

**As you can see I used GitHub :)**
